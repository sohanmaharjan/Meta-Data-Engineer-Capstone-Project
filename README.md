# Meta-Data-Engineer-Capstone-Project
This is a final project of Meta Database Engineer course on Coursera. This project showcases the learning of SQL, Python and Tableau.

As part of the final assessment criteria, some sample booking data for LittleLemon was provided. I had to save that data into MySQL database and do the following tasks:
  1.  Create a database that holds the data.
  2.  Connect to the database using a Python client.
  3.  Create a procedure using Python to react to changes in the data.
  4.  Connect to the database using Tableau.
  5.  Generate data reports using Tableau.
